    <p>Thanks for sticking with the labs so far. You are now into the  second of the Level 2 labs, and as always, this lab continues where the last  one left off. You will see a similar configuration to what you had previously.  The external domain might have changed, but everything else should be the same.</p>
    <p> During this lab, you will gain further insight into scaling  an Infinity solution, understanding more advanced administrative tasks, applying  techniques to tune your virtual environment, and how to customise the user experience. </p>
    <p>In the topology diagram, we add third-party systems and show the call flow as devices connect through Infinity to other devices and systems.</p>

    <p>As before, this <strong>lab guide</strong> is broken into tasks, and each task has two main components (most of the time):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Each task has a ‚Äústep-by-step‚Äù set of instructions to help you complete the required configurations and testing. This tells you ‚Äú<em>What</em>" to do, but not "<em>Why</em>" you are doing it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>At the top of each page, there is usually a ‚Äú<strong>More Info</strong>‚Äù button. You should take time to read this descriptive text that pops up when you click this button as it provides background information to the lab exercises, along with why you might deploy, configure and administer Infinity in the way we suggest.</p>
            <p>As an additional challenge, users that have previous experience with Pexip could attempt to deploy and configure Pexip using the information in this section alone (i.e. do NOT follow the step-by-step guide üò±).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As an accompaniment to the lab guide, there is a <strong>lab sheet</strong> containing all the necessary details (such as IP addresses, FQDNs, etc.) that you will use to configure your deployment. At the top of each task in the lab guide, there is usually a paragraph outlining the lab sheet section that relates to the task.</p>
    <p>Each task  refers to the relevant lab sheet section if required. For your information, we have tried to keep the usernames consistent and passwords simple, with <em>most</em> passwords set to a common value that you can see in the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>Please refer continuously to <a href="https://docs.pexip.com" title="Pexip Infinity Technical Documentation" target="_blank">https://docs.pexip.com</a>, our official technical documentation site for Pexip Infinity. In addition, we will provide you with links in each section to various documentation pages where appropriate.</p>
