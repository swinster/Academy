    <h1 id="header">Overview</h1>

    <p>The primary goal of this training lab guide is to walk you through how to plan a Pexip Infinity installation,
        configure and deploy different Infinity components such as the Management and Conferencing Nodes, and configure
        Infinity services as necessary to provide the desired outcomes.</p>
    <p>In these labs, you will deploy and install a Pexip Management Node, two internal Pexip Conferencing Nodes (in the
        Transcoding Role) within a LAN location, and one external Pexip Conferencing Node (initially in the Transcoding
        Role, then switching to the Proxying Edge role) within a DMZ location. You can see the topology in the diagram
        below. Both locations will handle standards-based SIP/H.323 and WebRTC video traffic, as well as integrate with
        different ecosystems. For example, the internal Pexip Conferencing Nodes will be integrated with an on-premises
        Skype for Business 2015 deployment, whilst the Pexip Edge Node will handle federated Microsoft calls via Lync or
        Skype for Business environments at other organisations, or Office 365. Additional integrations with Microsoft
        Teams, Google Hangouts and the Pexip Private Cloud will also be enabled.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You should refer continuously to&nbsp;<a class="general" href="https://docs.pexip.com" target="_blank"
            title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com</a>, which is our
        official documentation site regarding configuring Pexip. We will provide you with links in each section to
        various documentation pages where appropriate.</p>
    <p>The guide itself has broken into two parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A description of the desired outcomes (which you are reading now). It is intended that this will provide
            further background information to the lab exercises, along with how and why you might deploy and manage
            Infinity. This initial session guide also includes this introduction and guidance on accessing the
            lab.&nbsp;</li>
        <p>As an additional challenge, users that have previous experience with Pexip could attempt to deploy and
            configure
            Pexip using the information in this section alone.</p>
        <li>A step-by-step guide to complete the required configurations and relevant testing.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each group has a name (e.g. &ldquo;<span class="code">vc1</span>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<span
            class="code">vc2</span>&rdquo; etc., and may even have a location appended such
        as &ldquo;vc1-osl&rdquo;) and uses a shared domain space of pexip.net. These are used together to give a unique
        domain namespace for each group&rsquo;s lab (e.g., &ldquo;<span class="code">vc20-osl.pexip.net</span>&rdquo;).
        Each Node also has a
        hostname (e.g. &ldquo;<span class="code">mgr</span>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<span class="code">conf01</span>&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;<span class="code">edge</span>&rdquo;), and we can prepend this to the
        group domain to give the nodes Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs). We can then use these FQDNs to browse to
        the nodes (e.g., <a class="general" href="https://mgr.vc20-osl.pexip.net" target="_blank">https://mgr.vc20-osl.pexip.net</a> or
        <a class="general" href="https://edge.vc20-osl.pexip.net" target="_blank">https://edge.vc20-osl.pexip.net</a>).</p>
    <p>When managing devices in this lab, please refer to the lab sheet for your group. Each task will refer to the
        relevant lab sheet section if required. For your information, we have tried to keep the usernames consistent and
        passwords simple, with <em>most</em> passwords set to &ldquo;Pexip123&rdquo;. However, some usernames and
        passwords can be different, especially for cloud services, thus you should consult the lab sheet.</p>
