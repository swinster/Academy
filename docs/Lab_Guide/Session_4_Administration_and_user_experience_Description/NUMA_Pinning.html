    <h1 id="header">NUMA Pinning</h1>
    <p>Step-by-step page &ndash; None (you are on your own now ðŸ˜Š)</p>
    <p>Use <strong>section #3&nbsp;</strong>of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>Go to <a class="general" href="https://docs.pexip.com" target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com</a> <strong>--&gt;
            Installation&nbsp;</strong><strong>--&gt; VMware Installation&nbsp;</strong><strong>--&gt; VMware NUMA
            Affinity</strong> (or just search <strong>NUMA pinning</strong> in the docs, you should be fluent at this by
        now).</p>
    <p>Follow the instructions but be sure to adjust for the number of actual physical cores for your allocated NUMA
        node on your server. See Lab sheet <strong>section #3</strong> &ndash; if no NUMA node is specified, you have
        the whole server for your group. If you require further clarification, ask your trainer.</p>
    <p>As your Management Node is on the same server (perhaps even a single NUMA node), ensure you take account of its
        requirements too.</p>
    <p>Make a CPU budget of how you plan to deploy. Consult your trainer if you would like some confirmation that you
        are on the right path (HINT: our docs say that you should only configure this with one node per socket, however,
        in the lab we will take some artistic licence as there will be multiple nodes per socket, so the goal here is to
        see if you can get the procedure correct).</p>
