    <h1 id="header">Customising the User Experience</h1>
    <p>Step-by-step page &ndash; None (you are on your own now ðŸ˜Š)</p>
    <p>No specific lab sheet section.</p>
    <p>In Pexip Infinity you can apply customisations to most user-facing components so that you can deliver something
        unique to you, and for your users and customers. For example, you can fully customise the Connect Client
        interface (including the web app, desktop and mobile), in addition to the in-call experience. Brands and Themes
        are the different concepts applying to the client user interface and the in-call experience respectively.</p>
    <p>As of v17, we introduced a new user experience (known as the NextGen Connect client), and the older version is
        now known as the Legacy client. We have created some external web portal services where you can create branding
        templates for free; the NextGen and Legacy portals, used for each client group respectively. The NextGen portal
        allows for the customisation of the entire User Experience (both client interface and in-call experience),
        whereas the Legacy portal only allows for web app and desktop client customisation.</p>
    <p>Both portals can be accessed via the landing page at <a class="general" href="https://brandingportal.pexip.com/" target="_blank"
            title="Pexip Infinity Branding Portal">https://brandingportal.pexip.com/</a>, and each requires a separate
        login, so you will need to create an account for both. However, in this exercise, we will concentrate on the
        NextGen branding only.</p>
    <p>When you create custom branding, the web app experience is defined by a web template that you create and upload
        to the Management Node (or optionally to a reverse proxy). This can be further customised manually if you so
        wish.</p>

    <p>Step-by-step page &ndash; None (you are on your own now&nbsp;ðŸ˜Š)</p>
    <p>The portal experience is blurring the lines between client user interface customisation (known as Branding), and
        the in-call experiences (known as Theming), however, as these are applied to different elements of Pexip
        Infinity and in different ways, we have continued to document these areas separately. See&nbsp;<a
            href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/customize_clients.htm" target="_blank"
            title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/customize_clients.htm</a>
        for information on customising the client experience, and&nbsp;<a class="general" href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/themes.htm"
            target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/themes.htm</a> for information
        on customising the in-call experience.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Be aware of design choices for backgrounds on the areas where users will see messages (such as VR&rsquo;s and the
        &ldquo;waiting for host&rdquo; prompt), these should be not too busy or distracting. Think about accessibility
        (i.e. colour clashes, colour blindness etc, see&nbsp;<a class="general" href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/accessibility.htm"
            target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/accessibility.htm</a>),
        and logo watermarks are often better as an all-white image. Some nice royalty-free background images can be
        found at&nbsp;<a class="general" href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" title="Unspalsh">https://unsplash.com/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are four main edit sections (subject to change). Go through each section and create a NexGen user
        experience.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Edits:</strong> This allows you to change the look and feel of the Connect app and some in-call
            experience screens, plus adding the watermarking logo.</li>
        <li><strong>Customisation:</strong> Here you can change how the Connect app functions, such as the bandwidth
            options that are exposed to the user.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Splash Screens:</strong> In this section, you can adjust the main in-call experience themes.</li>
        <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Here you can set up translation strings for each of the static text elements
            within the clients. These user-defined languages can then be assigned to the Connect client via the
            Customisation menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To create a branding/theme package, you can select one or several of your edits (App Edits, Customization and/or
        Splash Screens), which will then create one or two zip files:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>branding.zip</strong> is a combination of the <strong>App Edits</strong>,
            <strong>Customisation</strong> and <strong>Languages</strong> sections which is uploaded as the web app
            customisation (<strong>Service Configuration&nbsp;</strong><strong>&agrave; Web App Customization</strong>).
        </li>
        <li>and <strong>ivr.zip</strong> which is mainly the <strong>Splash Screens</strong> edits but also incorporates
            the watermark logo from the <strong>App Edits&nbsp;</strong>section, which is then uploaded as a theme
            (<strong>Service Configuration --&gt; Themes</strong>) and assigned to individual
            Infinity services, or globally across the deployment.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
<p>Ttest out the new client interface and Infinity services.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> you can also brand the desktop client. This requires a bit more work, but as always, things are fully documented here - <a href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/customize_clients.htm#apply" target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs site">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/customize_clients.htm#apply</a>. From Infinty v25, you will need to ensure that the branding package you create is signed, and the client must upload a trusted (public) key before the branding can be applied. Unfortunately, as of version 1.8 on the Connect client, you cannot apply branding to the mobile clients. This is due to additional security restrictions.</p>
