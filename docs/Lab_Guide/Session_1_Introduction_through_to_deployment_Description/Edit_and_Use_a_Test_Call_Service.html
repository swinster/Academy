    <p>Use <strong>section #4.2&nbsp;</strong>of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>The Pexip Infinity Test Call Service is a feature both administrators and end-users can use to test and validate
        connections from different devices and clients. By default, there is already a test call service configured out
        of the box, which uses an alias of &ldquo;<span class="code">test_call</span>&rdquo;. You can change this alias if you like, and you
        should also add a new alias that contains the Pexip domain for your deployment.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Multiple aliases can be configured for Pexip Infinity services that allow different clients to connect to the
        same service. For example, a SIP client would dial a URI in the format&nbsp;<span class="code">user@domain</span>, and you would need to
        configure a suitable alias on the service to match this incoming call (using the&nbsp;<span class="code">Pexip Infinity
        Domain</span>&nbsp;for your group). However, you may only want WebRTC users to have to type the
        shorter&nbsp;<span class="code">user</span>&nbsp;part to access the same service.</p>
    <p>To test this service using webRTC, browse to an internal node and/or the edge node using its FQDN. Note the
        security warning in the browser. We will add TLS certificates to the Pexip Infinity nodes in the next session,
        so for the moment accept the warning and move on. Also note that the RDP server has a virtual camera installed
        allowing you to send a test video stream, however, it seems to flicker when multiple people use it at the same
        time&nbsp;â˜¹.&nbsp;</p>
