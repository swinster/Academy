    <p><img src="../../images/trascoding_node.svg" alt="" /></p>

    <p>Use <strong>section #3</strong> and <strong>section #5</strong> of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>For this step, we are going to install the Edge node in the <strong><u>transcoding role</u></strong>, so the
        procedure is all but identical to the previous step (although you should use the details outlined in
        <strong>section #5</strong>). We have already discussed that Conferencing Nodes in the Transcoding Role or
        Proxying Edge Role is the same software (if you remeber back to the Level 1 Fundamentals videos regarding Infinity Basics), so we will change its operation later just to show you how this can be
        done (we will do this in lab 2). Also, note how the node looks in live view, and we can compare this to how
        it might look later. <strong>NOTE:</strong> You would probably NOT do this in the real world, this is just a
        learning exercise ðŸ˜‰.</p>
    <p>The Edge nodes will use a dual NIC setup. The primary NIC talks to other Pexip nodes (the Management node and
        nodes that are required for Transcoding). The secondary NIC in this case will face the Internet. As the
        secondary NIC faces the largest number of unknown networks (i.e., potentially any network routable via the
        Internet, so the default gateway should reside in the subnet associated with this interface. A static 1:1 NAT has
        also been pre-defined for this external interface. As the primary NIC is in a different subnet to the Management
        Node and other transcoding nodes, a static route will need to be defined that allows traffic to be routed out of
        this interface and to the other subnets. As additional transcoding locations are defined that will be used by
        the Edge, such as when Pexip Smart Scale is deployed in a later session, so further static routes will need to
        be defined.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <u>When creating a dual NIC node that requires a static route to the management
        nodeâ€™s subnet, this <strong><u>MUST</u></strong> be added at step 4 in the node creation process</u>. If it is
        not added and the node is deployed, do not attempt to add the route manually as the configuration will be
        overwritten on reboot and the node will eventually lose communication with the Management Node. You should
        instead delete the node and recreate it with the correct static route in place. Other static routes can be added
        later with no issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might want to ensure you set the SIP TLS FQDN of the node at this point. This field is used by the node in
        its signalling with other remote devices. Without this field set, Pexip Infinity will not be able to talk to
        Skype for Business deployments and you will see an error in the support log to this effect when a Skype for
        Business call is received by the node. It must also match the details in the TLS certificate applied to the
        node, which will be added later.</p>
    <p>Each node has a self-signed certificate applied on creation. We will create and upload a public certificate for
        this node later (session 2).</p>
