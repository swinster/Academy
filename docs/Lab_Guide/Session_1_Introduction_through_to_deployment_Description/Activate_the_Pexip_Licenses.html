    <h1 id="header">Activate the Pexip Licenses</h1>
    <p>Use <strong>section #8&nbsp;</strong>of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>To start using any Pexip Infinity deployment, you need to activate a license. We will add different licenses as
        we go, but at a minimum, you need capacity, either &ldquo;port licenses&rdquo; (video connections) or
        &ldquo;audio licenses&rdquo; (audio connections). This will allow you to make gateway calls through Pexip. To
        use VMRs you will also need a VMR license. Scheduling is not currently used in these lab exercises but
        would allow Pexip to connect to an Exchange server so that we could schedule a meeting for a VMR using Exchange
        and Outlook. Many features can be enabled by just one license key. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>You should also note that whilst you need a license to make a call, you can continue to configure and even
        partially test the deployment <strong>without</strong> a license. When a call connects to Pexip without a
        license installed, you will see and hear a video message saying that no valid license is installed. This proves
        signalling and media paths are open and available. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Please refer to <a
            href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/licenses.htm" target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/licenses.htm</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <u>The license is your paid subscription to use Pexip.</u> If for any reason you need to
        move the Management Node, say to a different host or change its IP address, you <strong><u>MUST</u></strong>
        return the license before decommissioning the node. If you destroy the Management Node with the license still
        active, you will not be able to reuse the license. Pexip may then charge you to get up and running again. This
        procedure is also outlined and highlighted in the licensing email that you receive containing the license key.
    </p>
    <p>The same is true of a lab or pre-production setup you may have. <u>Do NOT destroy the lab without first returning
            the license!</u></p>
    <p>We do not spend time in this lab on moving the Management Node, however, such a change is quite a disruption to
        the system. You should refer to <a
            href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/management_node_move.htm" target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/management_node_move.htm</a>
        if you need to do this. &nbsp;</p>
