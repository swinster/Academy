    <h1 id="header">Create a Virtual Meeting Room (with no PIN)</h1>

    <p>Use <strong>section #4.2</strong> of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>One of the services in Pexip Infinity is Virtual Meeting Rooms (VMRs). When you create Pexip VMRs, you have
        multiple configuration options you could set. In the upcoming lab exercises, you will create different sorts of
        VMRs with different properties. For this step, create a standard VMR with no PIN codes that you can connect to
        using SIP devices and a shorter name for WebRTC users. Set the user part of the alias to <span class="code">vmr</span>.</p>
    <p>Please refer to <a class="general" href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/creating_editing_vmrs.htm" target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/creating_editing_vmrs.htm</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have now created your first VMR. Before you can make a call to the VMR, the configuration must synchronise to
        the Conferencing Nodes, so you must wait up to 60 seconds after making changes before they take effect. Every 60
        seconds, each Conferencing Node checks with the Management Node to see if any configuration changes are
        available. When the database with your new VMR is replicated to the Conferencing Nodes, you will be able to dial
        in and connect.</p>
    <p>To connect to your VMR, you can call from a browser. To do so, you can navigate to the Conferencing Node FQDNs,
        however for now the Nodes will have untrusted self-signed certificates, so you will need to accept the browser
        warnings (this will be fixed in a later step).</p>
    <p>If one user in the group connects to the external node (e.g.
        <strong class="code">https://edge.&lt;your_Infinity_domain&gt;</strong>) outside of the RDP session, and the other user
        connects to an internal node (e.g. <strong class="code">https://conf02.&lt;your_Infinity_domain&gt;</strong>), you should be
        able to create a distributed conference. Be aware that your web camera and microphone may not work via the RDP
        session (there is a virtual camera installed on the RDP server, but it has limited functionality). The trainer
        should also be able to connect to an internal node with an internal client to help you out if required.</p>
    <p>Check out Live View to see what is going on (please refer to&nbsp;<a
            href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/platform_status.htm" target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/platform_status.htm</a>).
        Note the <strong>backplane</strong> that is created between the two nodes.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To understand how Pexip handles a distributed conference, please read through the documentation at&nbsp;<a
            href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/dist_architecture.htm" target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/dist_architecture.htm</a>.
        This might seem like a lot of reading, but to fully understand Pexip Infinity, you need to understand how it
        operates. Indeed, you might need to read these pages several times as Pexip&rsquo;s architectural approach is
        unlike any other conferencing solution.&nbsp;</p>
