    <p>No specific lab sheet section.</p>
    <p>In the previous session, you deployed nodes in the LAN and the DMZ, and all were Transcoding Nodes (meaning that
        all Nodes decode incoming media and encode outgoing media). This is useful in some deployments (such as
        geographically distributed systems or a Service Provider model) as users can join the transcoding location that
        is closest to them, and Infinity automatically figures out if other users in another location have joined the
        same conference, so will form a &ldquo;<strong>backplane</strong>&rdquo; between the nodes. The
        <strong>backplanes</strong> are an important concept in the world of Pexip as they carry media and signalling
        between the Nodes that are being used to host the same conference, and this is far more efficient on bandwidth
        than if all users had to connect to a specific location. Multiple transcoding locations are often deployed
        across geographically dispersed sites and data centres.</p>
    <p>Ensure you have run a test connection into a VMR using multiple endpoints connecting to the Edge node. Note how
        the calls are handled by this node in Live View.</p>
    <p>However, transcoding is compute-intensive and for this traditional LAN/DMZ scenario, it might be more efficient
        to concentrate compute resources in one location and simply &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; media via the DMZ location
        toward the LAN Nodes. We outlined that Pexip is a fully transcoding environment, so the proxying edge role in
        Pexip (as of today) is all about getting media from a remote device to a Pexip transcoding node. It is important
        to understand that the Proxying Edge role is not about proxying one remote users&rsquo; media <u>directly</u> to
        another, instead it MUST be directed initially to a transcoding location.</p>
    <p>To switch to a proxying solution, you need to complete two steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The role of the node needs to be changed (from a Transcoding Role to a Proxying Edge role).</li>
        <li>Then the transcoding resource of the location needs to be updated (to target a location that contains
            Transcoding Nodes instead of &ldquo;This Location&rdquo;, which will now only contain Proxy node(s).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That&rsquo;s it!</p>

    </p>
    <p>You can convert any node and location very simply as the underlying software for each role type is identical,
        however, each node role has very different compute and host requirements. You should plan for these changes and
        understand what you might need to alter on the guest VM (such as vCPUs and vRAM within the hypervisor) and
        understand the knock-on effects it can have on the host. <u>Proxying nodes still require dedicated host
            resources</u>, we are still dealing with real-time media and overcommitting host resources will end up
        delivering poor quality and performance. Also, be aware that you cannot mix and match different Conferencing
        Node role types (Transcoding and Proxying Edge) in the same System Location. Please refer to <a
