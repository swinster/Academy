    <h1 id="header">Create a Virtual Reception (also known as a Lobby or IVR)</h1>
    <p>Use <strong>section #5&nbsp;</strong>of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>Virtual Receptions (VRs) allow you to transfer calls from a lobby area into other services (such as a VMR or VA).
        This is useful if callers are unable to dial into a VMR directly, or if you want to provide a single alias for
        certain call types, such as an IP address for H.323 IP dialling, a PSTN alias for a SIP trunk from a VoIP
        provider (which we will look at in the next session), or a simple static URI alias that does not change and
        which could be added to a phonebook entry. When users land in a VR, they will need to enter a numeric alias
        (using DTMF codes on a video endpoint) to be transferred into an alternative service, such as a VMR or VA. This
        also enables endpoints that only utilise a numeric keypad, to connect to a VMR.</p>
    <p>Once the VR has been configured, you will also need to configure a numeric alias on VMRs or VAs that you want
        users to transfer themselves into. These can be thought of as conference codes.</p>
    <p>VRs are also known as IVRs (Interactive Voice Response) which derives from telephony systems.</p>
    <p>It is possible to customise the VRs to provide a different look and feel via a themes using our <a href="https://brandingportal.pexip.com/" title="Branding Portal" target="_blank">Branding Portal</a>, which we will cover in a later lab. You can also chaange things like voice prompts, although for this you will need to manually customise the theme (see <a href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/themes_file_requirements.htm" target="_blank" title="Pexip Infinity Technical Docs">Rules and requirements for customized themes).</a></p>
