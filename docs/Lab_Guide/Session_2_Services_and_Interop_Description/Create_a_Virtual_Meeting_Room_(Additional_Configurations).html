    <h1 id="header">Create a Virtual Meeting Room (Additional Configurations)</h1>
    <p>Use <strong>section #4.2&nbsp;</strong>of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>In this step, you will create more VMRs and re-test the conferences. Again, work with one user connected to the
        edge node and one to the internal node and remember to check out <strong>Live View</strong> to see how things
        are different this time around.</p>
    <p>Please also refer to <a
            href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/about_aliases.htm">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/about_aliases.htm</a>,
        which outline many of the ways Pexip can match incoming calls.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Create 5 different VMRs with different options.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a secure VMR to allow some users to manage the conference.
            <ul>
                <li>One team member enters the host pin, and another the guest pin.</li>
                <li>See what the differences are for each users&rsquo; in-conference capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a semi-secure VMR allowing easy access for guests.
            <ul>
                <li>The first user (guest) joins the conference, enters the lobby, and waits.</li>
                <li>The next user (host) connects to the VMR, enters the lobby and enters the host pin to start the
                    meeting.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a secure VMR only for C level users.
            <ul>
                <li>One user enters the host pin, then the next user enters the host pin as well.</li>
                <li><u>Both</u> users are now connected to the VMR with the same rights.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a VMR to show two main speakers but do not allow presentation.
            <ul>
                <li>When the two users are connected to the VMR you will see a different layout.</li>
                <li>Add more friends (PexEps) to test the layout with more people.</li>
                <li>Now try to share your screen.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a VMR to show participant names and limit the room capacity to 3.
            <ul>
                <li>When the two users are connected to the VMR, the name of the participant is displayed below each of
                    their video feeds.</li>
                <li>Try to bring in your PexEp friends from earlier.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Make sure you also test different layouts (such as Adaptive Composition) in different VMRs. These are set per
        VMR, so all users receive the same layout. You can set the default layout by configuring the
        “<strong>View</strong>” option.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> in a later task, we will customise the WebApp branding and add a plugin that allows a host to change this default layout from the controls in the client.</p>
