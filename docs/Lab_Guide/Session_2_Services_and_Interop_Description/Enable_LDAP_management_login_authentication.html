    <h1 id="header">Enable LDAP management login authentication</h1>
    <p>Use <strong>section #2&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;section #9&nbsp;</strong>of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>Adding additional administrators to Pexip Infinity requires integration with an LDAP directory service, allowing
        these users to log in with their directory credentials, which is generally a Windows AD domain. Pexip Infinity
        only has a single local administrator account, so integration with LDAP allows multiple users to administer the
        platform, which allows better auditing of changes and more control given you can assign specific groups of
        users&rsquo; different privileges.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Once you have enabled this on your labs, you should use your user account to administer the system going forward.
        When you take screenshots of the Management Node&rsquo;s GUI, be sure to include the logged-in user seen in the
        top right of the screen. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>When setting up LDAP for administrator authentication, three sections need to be completed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Set the actual connection to the LDAP server:</strong>&nbsp; This includes the paths and filters
            used to search the LDAP database for users that are looking to authenticate and the security groups which
            are used to assign specific privileges.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Set the administrator roles for Pexip Infinity:</strong> There are two roles defined OOTB (full
            admin read/write, and a read-only role), although you can define custom roles depending on your needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Map the administrator role to a security group.&nbsp;</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more secure systems, the local admin account login can be disabled for web access by ensuring the
        authentication source is the LDAP database only. If this has been set, then be aware that should Pexip Infinity
        be unable to reach the LDAP database, web admin logins will not work. This authentication source can only then
        be reset via the SSH admin login. There are currently no additional accounts that can be added to the SSH login.
        It is also possible to force the use of client certificates for authentication that would normally be
        distributed via group policy (or similar), although for this lab it is not something you will be using.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>When setting up the LDAP connection, you will need to set the server and credentials you will use to connect to
        the LDAP database (the latter usually being some service account), but you will also likely want to set the base
        Distinguished Name (DN) that will form the starting point of any query against the LDAP service. If you have a
        large directory, additional paths can be appended to narrow the search to a specific Organisational Unit (OU) if
        required, although you will not do this in this lab.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will use the default administrator roles and map them to some predefined security groups.</p>

        addition, LDAP syntax can be quirky, so referring to our LDAP troubleshooting guide can be a lifesaver (see <a
