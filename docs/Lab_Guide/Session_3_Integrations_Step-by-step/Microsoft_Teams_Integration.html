        <p>The first step will be to configure your Pexip Infinity deployment with the integration details of the Teams
            connector:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install the Teams license (<strong>Platform&nbsp;--&gt; Licenses</strong>). This may
                have
                already been completed depending on the license keys used.</li>
            <li>Configure your Microsoft Teams Tenant (<strong>Call Control</strong> --&gt;
                <strong>Microsoft Teams Tenant</strong>).</li>
            <li>Add a Teams Connector (<strong>Call Control --&gt; Microsoft Teams
                Connectors</strong>). 
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure you tick the <strong>Enable enhanced status information</strong> property and fill in the <strong>Azure Event Hub connection string</strong> to enable more advanced monitoring.<br> 
                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> The <strong>Azure Event Hub connection string</strong> should be one continuous line of text, however, the PDF creation process for the Lab Sheet inserts non-printing paragraph characters and the end of the lines. Please copy the entire string to notepad++ (or similar) and ensure that the lines are concatenated. We will try to fix this in a later version of the Lab Sheets.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
<li>Assign the Connector to a Location (<strong>Platform --&gt; Locations</strong> and
                select
                the required location).</li>

        <h4 class="main">Creating the Virtual Reception (lobby) for indirect dialling into a Teams meeting:</h4>

        <p>To configure the&nbsp;Virtual Reception:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a Teams Virtual Reception (<strong>Services --&gt; Virtual Receptions</strong>).
            </li>
            <li>Then enter the <strong>Name, &ldquo;Teams VR&rdquo;</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select the correct <strong>Virtual reception type</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select the <strong>Teams Connector</strong>.</li>
            <li>Set the <strong>Lookup Location</strong> to be your &ldquo;<strong>DMZ</strong>&rdquo; location.</li>
            <li>Set the <strong>Post-lookup RegEx match</strong> to <span class="code">(.*)</span>.</li>
            <li>Set the <strong>Post lookup RegEx replace string</strong> to <span class="code">teams.\1@&lt;your Pexip
                    Infinity domain&gt;</span>.
            </li>
            <li>Add the <strong>Aliases</strong> you wish to use<br>NOTE: These would normally match the Teams invite
                IVR
                URI that would be set as part of the <span
                    class="code">New-CsVideoInteropServiceProvider</span>&nbsp;Cmdlet run during the connector
                installation. As the Teams connector is shared for this lab, this is an alias pointing to your
                trainer&apos;s deployment (vc20), but you should create something that would be matched for
                <em>your</em>
                deployment (e.g. <span class="code">teams@vc1-osl.pexip.net</span>). You may also wish to
                use the IPv4 static NAT address of your Edge node as an alias to your Teams VR, but if you do and you
                have
                completed the other steps correctly from session 2, you will receive an error as you can only use unique
                aliases. In a production environment, if you want to use IP address aliases for multiple VRs, you will
                require multiple Conferencing nodes to target.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>

        <h3 class="main">Testing</h3>

        <p><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> there is a limitation in this lab exercise as we are using a single Azure
            tenant
            and MS365 subscription for all lab groups. Ideally, we would use a single tenant per group, but we have yet
            to
            find a practical way to achieve this. This limitation means that we can only add one CVI setting, and this
            points to just one group, which is the demo deployment used by the trainer (group vc20). All users will
            therefore get Teams Invite links that point to this group rather than your group, however, you can
            substitute
            this groups domain information for your own group&rsquo;s details. For example, the Teams meeting Invite
            would
            always link to the Virtual Reception <a class="general" href="mailto:teams@vc20-osl.pexip.net">teams@<span
                    class="highlight">vc20</span>-osl.pexip.net</a>,
            however, if you were in group vc1, you would use <a class="general" href="mailto:teams@vc1-osl.pexip.net">teams@<span
                    class="highlight">vc1</span>-osl.pexip.net</a>.</p>
        <p>To create a Teams meeting, you need to log into the Teams client (on your <strong>OWN</strong> laptop/PC, <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> in the RDP session) with the credentials for your user and group
        (see Section #12 in the lab sheet). If you already use a Teams login, you could either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Log out of the Teams client and use the lab login details.</li>
            <li>Use the Teams WebApp (potentially, you may need an incognito browser session) <a
                    href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Use the awesome free Portals app</strong> from My Teams Lab that allows you to set up and test
                multiple Teams user logins (see <a
                    href="https://www.myteamslab.com/2020/01/portals-for-office-365.html">https://www.myteamslab.com/2020/01/portals-for-office-365.html</a>).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can set up a Teams meeting in a couple of ways via the calendar:</p>
        <p><strong>Using New Meeting:</strong></p>
        <p>Click the <strong>Calendar</strong> Tab, then &ldquo;<strong>New Meeting</strong>&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<img src="../../images/Teams_calendar_new_meeting.png" alt="image"></p>
        <p>You MUST ensure that you add an attendee (such as <em>your</em> email address) otherwise the Teams Meeting
            invite
            details will not be added. Even so, these details will not appear until you have saved the invite and
            re-opened
            it:</p>
        <p><strong>Initial Meeting invite with no Join instructions:</strong></p>
        <p><img src="../../images/Teams_invite_no_join_instructions.png" alt="image"></p>
        <p><strong>Meeting Invite re-opened once it has been &ldquo;Sent&rdquo;:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Be aware that the domain seen will be that of “<span
                class="highlight">vc20</span>-osl.pexip.net”, and the
            “Alternate VTC dialling instructions” link will also point to the VC20 edge node. <strong><u>Please

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Using Meet Now:&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>This is a little clunky and it may be that Microsoft will continue to work on this (it has changed a few
            times
            recently), but at the time of writing, you should be able to follow these steps:</p>
        <p>Click the <strong>Calendar</strong> Tab, then &ldquo;<strong>Meet Now</strong>&rdquo;, then
            &ldquo;<strong>Start
                Meeting</strong>&rdquo;:</p>
        <p><img src="../../images/Teams_meet_now_join.png" alt="image"></p>
        <p>Click &ldquo;<strong>Join Now</strong>&rdquo;(there is a link that says &ldquo;Other join options&rdquo;, but
            it
            simply seems to turn from purple to white and nothing else),. Once in the meeting, Click &ldquo;<strong>More
                actions</strong>&rdquo; (the three dots in the action bar), then select</p>
        <p><img src="../../images/Teams_meet_now_additional_steps.png" alt="image"></p>
        <p><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> As before, the domain seen will be that of &ldquo;<span

            the &ldquo;Alternate VTC dialling instructions&rdquo; link will also point to the VC20 edge node.
            <strong><u>Please ignore this and use the domain for your group.</u></strong> Calls should be therefore
            routed
            through <em>your</em> groups Infinity deployment, and if you have set things up correctly, will work just

        <h4 class="main">Using the Pexip Infinity Virtual Reception to Teams gateway service:</h4>

        <p>After the Virtual Reception and Call Routing Rule have been configured, third-party systems and devices can
            now
            dial the alias of the Virtual Reception (e.g. <span class="code">teams@&lt;your Pexip Infinity
                domain&gt;</span>) and then, when prompted
            by the IVR service, enter the meeting code of the Teams conference they want to join. The&nbsp;Pexip
            Infinity
            distributed gateway&nbsp;will then route the call into the appropriate Teams conference.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4 class="main">Using the direct gateway service:</h4>

        <p>After the Call Routing Rule has been configured, third-party systems and devices can now dial an alias that
            matches your specified pattern (e.g. <span class="code">teams.1234567890@&lt;your Pexip Infinity
                domain&gt;</span>) to be routed directly
            into the appropriate Teams conference (in this example the conference with a meeting code of 1234567890).
        </p>
        <p>In both cases, try dialling from a registered device or internal connection, and from an external connection
            to
            ensure that lobby bypass is working as expected.&nbsp;</p>
