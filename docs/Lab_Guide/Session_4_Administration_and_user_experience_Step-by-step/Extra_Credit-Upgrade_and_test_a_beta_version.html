    <h1 id="header">Extra Credit: Upgrade and test a beta version</h1>
    <p>Suggested completion time: <strong>20 minutes</strong></p>
    <p>Use <strong>section #3&nbsp;</strong>of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>See the previous upgrade section for the procedure, but this time upgrade to a beta version of Infinity. Ensure
        you have backed up the configuration and created VM snapshots before you upgrade (especially given this is beta
        software), and remember to remove the VM snapshots when you have tested your system.</p>
    <p>Beta software should only be run in test environments, as it will contain pre-release code that could have
        unintended side effects. It&rsquo;s a great way to test new features or to ensure that any documented change in
behaviour helps with a particular issue.</p>
    <p>There are some rules to be aware of when upgrading:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The beta version you are upgrading <em>to,</em> MUST have been <strong>released</strong> AFTER the version of software you
            are running. Each new software version is coded with previously released versions, so you might find some
            beta software is older than the GA release of a previous version. Check the dates of release of the
        software.</li>
        <li>You can only upgrade <em>from</em> a beta version to the next beta, release candidate, or GA version of the
            same release (i.e. v26 beta 2 will allow you to upgrade to v26 GA, but not v26.1 GA or v27 beta 1).</li>
        <li>Released beta versions <em>should</em> be supported in the Pexip Private Cloud. If you see issues after upgrading relating to  PSS not support the current version, please let your trainer know.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask your trainer for links to the beta documentation and information about the new version.</p>
<p>Currently this is (not avaliable :( ):</p>
