    <h1 id="header">Infinity Connect Client Registration and Gateway P2P calls</h1>
    <p>Use <strong>section #4.2</strong> of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>Routing rules are one of the most flexible and complicated configuration pages in Pexip Infinity, so let&rsquo;s
        practice and at the same time download, install and register the Pexip <strong><u>Connect client for
                Infinity</u></strong>. This client should be installed on YOUR computer, <u>not</u> the RDP server. In
        addition, the Infinity Connect client is <u>not</u> the same thing as the Pexip My Meeting Video client used by
        the Pexip Service. We are working on a replacement app that can be used by both Infinity and the Service, so
        watch this space.</p>
    <p>We need routing rules to be added to enable registered devices to call each other, and both call and be called
        by, external systems. These are known as gateway calls.</p>
    <p>Please refer to <a

    <ol>
        <li>Setup a <strong>Device Alias</strong> (this is the identifier used to dial the device &ndash; usually it
            will look like a URI), and <strong>register</strong> a Pexip Connect client to your
            deployment.
			<p>For registering to a Pexip Conference or Proxy Node, you must first create a Device
            Alias. Refer to <a
                href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/registering_devices.htm" target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/registering_devices.htm</a>
            and <a
                href="https://docs.pexip.com/end_user/guide_for_admins/about_client_settings.htm" target="_blank" title="Pexip Docs">https://docs.pexip.com/end_user/guide_for_admins/about_client_settings.htm</a>
			</p>
        </li>
        <li>Configure a <strong>Call Routing Rule</strong> so it is possible to dial <strong><u>from</u></strong>
            internal and external systems <strong><u>to</u></strong> registered clients <span class="code">@&lt;Pexip Infinity
            domain&gt;</span>.
			<p>The key here is to ensure your RegEx rule matches your domain, and that the
            call target is directed towards &ldquo;Registered devices only&rdquo;. You probably want to ensure that both
            &ldquo;inbound&rdquo; and &ldquo;outbound&rdquo; calls are matched, so you can call a registered device
				directly from a VMR.</p>
	  </li>
        <li>Configure a <strong>Call Routing Rule</strong> so you can dial <strong><u>from</u></strong> registered
            devices (and VMRs) <strong><u>to</u></strong> any public IP as H.323 &ndash; ideally, you can test with an
            available hardware endpoint (<strong>Note:</strong> you can get extra credit if you can explain how the IP
            match RegEx works!).
			<p>This is similar to the above, although the RegEx match needs to
            capture a dialled IP address. There are several ways to do this, so check the RegEx examples to
            cut&rsquo;n&rsquo;paste.
			</p>
	  </li>
        <li>Configure a <strong>Call Routing Rule</strong> so you can dial <strong><u>from</u></strong> registered
            devices (and VMRs) <strong><u>to</u></strong> any external system via the DMZ (<span class="code">something@domain</span>) as SIP
            &ndash; ideally, you can test with an available hardware endpoint.
			<p>Here, it is important to
            ensure that you do not cause a loop. Ignore your domain (you can use a <a

                RegEx example</a>) and that the inbound call is matched only from registered devices. Often, these are
		  one of the last rules to add to a system.</p>
