    <h1 id="header">Worksheet for Capturing Screenshots</h1>
    <p>Here you will find a direct link to download the worksheet that needs to be completed for your lab. It will guide you to grab screenshots of your working Infinity deployment. It provides a record of your achievements and allows us to ensure all aspects of the labs have been completed before we issue the relevant accreditation.</p>
	<p>At the end of the labs, add all the worksheets to a zip file and upload that file to our portal (we will give you guidance on how to do this at the end of the lab).</p>
<p><strong>HINT:</strong> if you are part of a group, then work as a team! You only need one set of worksheets completed per group, as we expect you to be working together on the same things. You could for example take it, in turn, to fill in the worksheets - there are 4 in total, although it would be great if you uploaded all 4 in the same zip file.</p>
	<p><strong>HINT 2:</strong> take the screenshots as you go. It's much simpler to capture things immediatly that to go back at the end and try to replicate everything again.</p>
