    <p>Here you will find a direct link to download the worksheet that needs to be completed for your lab. It will guide you to grab screenshots of your working Infinity deployment. It provides a record of your achievements and allows us to ensure all aspects of the labs have been completed before we issue the relevant accreditation.</p>
	<p>At the end of the labs, add all the worksheets to a zip file and upload that file to our portal (we will give you guidance on how to do this at the end of the lab).</p>
