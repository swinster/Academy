    <p>Congratulations, two labs complete &#128079;!</p>
    <p>You now have the essential skills to enhance the basic Infinity deployment and provide enhanced security with trusted TLS certificates, and more granular administration capability and auditing. At the same time, you have looked at the fundamental services Infinity delivers, and how DNS provides a mechanism to allow devices to register and place calls into an Infinity deployment.</p>
    <p>In the next level, you ramp up your understanding of Infinity and take on Routing Rules and Gateway services. Unfortunately, we left the registered clients only able to call into the configured Infinity services and could not dial each other point-to-point. Routing Rules answer this problem, but they also lie at the beating heart of all Pexip Infinity integrations, such as Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business, Google Meet, Epic Telehealth, etc. Level 2 looks at this configuration and how Infinity is at the centre of a modern enterprise communication strategy.</p>
    <p>Further, we will look at the platform customisation and advanced architecture, such as understanding how media is handled within an Infinity deployment, a deeper look at advanced networking scenarios and how Infinity can scale with cloud bursting and Pexip Private Cloud. In addition, we will start to understand how you could extend the Infinity solution via its API's and Policy engines.</p>
    <p>So, get your PexPants on and contact us regarding entry to Level 2. Reach out to the Pexip Academy team via <a href="mailto:learning@pexip.com" title="Pexip Academy Team" target="_blank">learning@pexip.com,</a> or connect with your local Pexip Solution Architect for more information.</p>
