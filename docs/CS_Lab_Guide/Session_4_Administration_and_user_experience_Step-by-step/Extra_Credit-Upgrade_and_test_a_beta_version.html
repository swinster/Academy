    <h1 id="header">Extra Credit: Upgrade and test a beta version</h1>
    <p>Suggested completion time: <strong>20 minutes</strong></p>
    <p>Use <strong>section #3</strong> of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>See the previous upgrade section for the procedure, but this  time upgrade to a beta version of Infinity (if available). Again, ensure you  have backed up the configuration and created VM snapshots before upgrading  (especially given this is beta software). Remember to remove the VM snapshots  when you have tested your system.</p>
<p>Beta software should only be run in test environments, as it  will contain pre-release code that could have unintended side effects. On the  other hand, it&rsquo;s a great way to test new features or ensure that any documented  change in behaviour helps with a particular issue.</p>
<p>There are some rules to be aware of when upgrading:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The beta version you are upgrading <em><strong>to</strong></em> MUST has been <strong>released</strong> AFTER the software you are running. Each new software version is coded with  previously released versions, so you might find some beta software is older  than the GA release of a previous version. Check the release dates of the  software.</li>
        <li>You can only upgrade <strong><em>from</em></strong> a beta version to the next beta,  release candidate, or GA version of the same release (i.e. v26 beta 2 will  allow you to upgrade to v26 GA, but not v26.1 GA or v27 beta 1).</li>
        <li>Pexip Private Cloud supports released beta versions of Infinity.  Please let your trainer know if you see an alarm warning after upgrading PSS stating  that it does not support the current version.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask your trainer for links to the beta documentation and information about the new version.</p>
<p>Currently, this is (not available â˜¹)</p>
