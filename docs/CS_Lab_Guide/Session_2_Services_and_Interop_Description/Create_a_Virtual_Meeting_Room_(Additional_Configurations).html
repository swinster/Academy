<h1 id="header">Create a Virtual Meeting Room (Additional Configurations)</h1>
<p>Use <strong>section #4.2</strong> of the lab sheet.</p>
<section>
    <p>In this step, you will create more VMRs and re-test the  conferences. Again, test with one call placed internally to an internal node,  and another externally to the edge node. Remember to check out <strong>Live Vie</strong>w to see  how things are different this time around.</p>
    <p>Please also refer to <a href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/about_aliases.htm" title="Infinity Technical Docs" target="_blank">https://docs.pexip.com/admin/about_aliases.htm</a>, which outline many of the ways Pexip can match incoming calls.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Create five different VMRs with different options.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a secure VMR to allow only users with the correct  PINs to enter the VMR.
            <ul>
                <li>Place an internal call using the host PIN, and an external  call using the guest PIN.</li>
                <li>See what the differences are for each users' in-conference capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a semi-secure VMR allowing easy access for guests.
            <ul>
                <li>The first user (guest) joins the conference, enters the lobby, and waits.</li>
                <li>The next user (host) connects to the VMR, enters the lobby and enters the host pin to start the meeting. The guest has moved automatically from the lobby into the VMR.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a secure VMR only for C level users.
            <ul>
                <li>One user enters the host pin, and then the following user also  enters the host pin. There is no option for guests to enter a pin or &quot;join&quot; the conference.</li>
                <li><u>Both</u> users are now connected to the VMR with the same rights.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a VMR to show two main speakers but do not allow presentation.
            <ul>
                <li>When the two users are connected to the VMR you will see a different layout.</li>
                <li>Add more friends (PexEps) to test the layout with more people.</li>
                <li>Now try to share your screen.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a VMR to show participant names and limit the room capacity to 3.
            <ul>
                <li>When  the two users are connected to the VMR, the participants' names are displayed  below each video feed.</li>
                <li>Try to bring in your PexEp friends from earlier.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Make sure to test different layouts in different VMRs (such  as Adaptive Composition). For example, you can set the default layout by  configuring the &quot;<strong>View</strong>&quot; option. You select a layout per VMR service, but remember  that all users receive the same layout. </p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> in a later task, we will customise the WebApp branding and add a plugin that allows a host to change this default layout from the controls in the client.</p>
