    <p>A Virtual Auditorium is a VMR with a special layout. It  keeps guests focused on the lecturer (host), no matter if other guests are  speaking. The lecturer can view many guests, allowing them to keep an eye on  the entire class. These are used mainly for lecture and town hall meetings  where only a few main speakers should remain the focus of attention. </p>
