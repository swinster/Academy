<p>Use <strong>section #4.2</strong> and <strong>#5</strong> of the lab sheet.</p>
<section>
    <p>Virtual Receptions (VRs) allow you to transfer calls from a lobby area into other services (for example, a VMR or VA). This is useful if callers cannot dial into a VMR directly or if you want to provide a single alias for certain call types. For example, allowing users to dial an IP address via H.323, a PSTN number via a SIP trunk from a VoIP provider (which we will look at in an upcoming lab), or a static URI alias that could be added as a phonebook entry. When users land in a VR, they will need to enter a numeric alias (using DTMF codes on a video endpoint), which will transfer them into an alternative service, such as a VMR or VA. Thus, it enables endpoints that only utilise a numeric keypad to connect to a VMR.</p>
    <p>Once you have configured a VR, you will also need to configure a numeric alias on the VMR or VAs where you would like users to transfer. These can be thought of as conference codes.</p>
    <p>VRs are also known as IVRs (Interactive Voice Response), which derives from telephony systems.</p>
    <p>You can customise the VRs to provide a different look and feel via a theme (for example, by using our <a href="https://brandingportal.pexip.com/" title="Branding Portal" target="_blank">Branding Portal</a>, which we will cover in a later lab). So, for example, you can change things like backgrounds, text elements, and even voice prompts, although you will need to manually customise the theme (see <a href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/themes_file_requirements.htm" target="_blank" title="Infinity Technical Docs">Rules and requirements for customized themes</a>) for a custom voice prompt.</p>
