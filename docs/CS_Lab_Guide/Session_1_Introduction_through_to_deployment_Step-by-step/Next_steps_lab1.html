    <p>Congratulations, you have reached the end of this lab &#128079;!</p>
    <p>You now have the fundamental understanding to enable you to plan, design and deploy a basic Infinity solution. However, there are still a few more steps that you should complete to ensure the platform meets our best practices. For example, you should enhance its security by adding trusted TLS certificates to the nodes, and enabling better auditing and granular administration capabilities. We will cover these topics in <strong>lab 2</strong> in the series, &quot;<strong>Configuring additional fundamental Infinity services</strong>&quot;. At the same time, we will look at some essential Infinity services, which will enable you to use the platform as a stand-alone videoconferencing solution.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the knowledge you have gained so far would allow you to deploy Infinity for <strong>One Touch Join</strong> (OTJ). OTJ provisions Cisco an  Poly endpoints with meeting information from your enterprise calendaring systems, such as Exchange or Google Calander, allowing end-users to join a video-enabled meeting on any platform (e.g. Pexip, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Cisco WebEx, Zoom, GoToMeeting etc.) through a single click. Please see our OTJ eLearning module for more information. Although OTJ doesn't require any trusted TLS certificates or additional administrators, we highly recommend that you still add these items for this use case, so lab 2 is a good next step (along with the OTJ eLearning module)</p>
    <p>So what should you do now? If you like, you can reset the lab and go again, this time without using the step-by-step guide &#128561;. Alternatively, shut down this lab (by closing the browser tabs) and move on to <strong>lab 2</strong> in this series, &quot;<strong>Configuring additional fundamental Infinity services</strong>&quot;. Don't forget to complete the OTJ eLearning module as well. </p>
