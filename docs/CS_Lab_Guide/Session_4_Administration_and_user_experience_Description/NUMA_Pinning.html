<p>Step-by-step page â€“ None (you are on your own now &#128522;).
<section>
    <p>Use <strong>section #3 </strong>of the lab sheet.</p>
    <p>Go to <a class="general" href="https://docs.pexip.com" target="_blank" title="Infinity Technical Docs">https://docs.pexip.com</a><strong> --&gt; Installation --&gt; VMware Installation --&gt; VMware NUMA Affinity</strong> (or just search <strong>NUMA pinning</strong> in the docs, you should be fluent at this by now).</p>
    <p>Follow the instructions but be aware that the ESXi host doesn't  support hyperthreading in this lab, so this is more about understanding the  procedure involved. See Lab sheet <strong>section #3</strong>. If you require further  clarification, ask your trainer.</p>
    <p>As your Management Node is on the same server, ensure you  take account of its requirements too.</p>
    <p>Make a CPU budget of how you plan to redeploy your VM nodes.  Then, consult your trainer if you would like confirmation that you are on the  right path. </p>
    <p><strong>HINT:</strong> our docs say you should only configure affinity  with one node per socket. However, in the lab and due to restrictions on the  ESXi host, we will take some &quot;artistic licence&quot; as there will be  multiple nodes per socket, so the goal here is to see if you can get the  procedure correct.</p>
