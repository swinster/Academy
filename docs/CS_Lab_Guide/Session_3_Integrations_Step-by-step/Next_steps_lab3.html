<section>
    <p>Well done on completing the first Level 2 lab. You are well  on the way to becoming an expert in the administration and application of Pexip  Infinity.</p>
<p>You now have the skills to tackle most typical integrations  and call routing scenarios, which forms the crux of Critical Meetings and  Infrastructure deployments using Infinity. </p>
<p>In the next lab, you will look at additional administration  and customisation of the Infinity platform. You also look at how to scale your  Infinity deployment using the Pexip Private Cloud and Pexip Smart Scale  technology.    </p>
<p>Keep up the excellent work, and good luck.</p>
