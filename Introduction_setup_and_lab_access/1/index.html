<h1 id="header">Overview</h1>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"></p><p>The primary goal of
this training lab guide is to walk you through how to plan a Pexip Infinity installation,
configure and deploy different Infinity components such as the Management and Conferencing
Nodes, and to configure Infinity services as necessary to provide the desired
outcomes.</p>

<p>In these labs, you will
deploy and install a Pexip Management Node, two internal Pexip Conferencing
Nodes (in the Transcoding Role) within a LAN location, and one external Pexip Conferencing
Node (initially in the Transcoding Role, then switching to the Proxying Edge
role) within a DMZ location. You can see the topology in the diagram below. Both
locations will handle standards-based SIP/H.323 and WebRTC video traffic, as
well as integrate with different ecosystems. For example, the internal Pexip
Conferencing Nodes will be integrated with an on-premises Skype for Business
2015 deployment, whilst the Pexip Edge Node will handle federated Microsoft
calls via Lync or Skype for Business environments at other organisations, or
Office 365. Additional integrations with Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts and
the Pexip Private Cloud will also be enabled. </p>

<p>You should refer continuously
to <a href="https://docs.pexip.com">https://docs.pexip.com</a>,
which is our official documentation site regarding configuring Pexip. We will
provide you with links in each section to various documentation pages where
appropriate.</p>

<p>The guide itself has
broken into two parts:</p>

<p></p><ul><li>A
description of the desired outcomes (which you are reading now). It is intended
that this will provide further background information to the lab exercises,
along with how and why you might deploy and manage Infinity. This initial
session guide also includes this introduction and guidance on accessing the
lab.<br><br>As an additional challenge, users
that have previous experience with Pexip could attempt to deploy and configure
Pexip using the information in this section alone.</li></ul><p></p>

<p></p><ul><li>A
step-by-step guidance to complete the required configurations and relevant
testing. </li></ul><p></p>

<p>Each group has a name (e.g. “<span class="" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, mono;">vc1</span>”, “<span class="" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, mono;">vc2</span>”
etc., and may even have a location appended such as “<span class="" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, mono;">vc1-osl</span>”) and uses a shared
domain space of <span class="" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, mono;">pexip.net</span>.
These are used together to give a unique domain namespace for each group’s lab
(e.g., “<span class="" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, mono;">vc20-osl.pexip.net</span>”).
Each Node also has a hostname (e.g. “<span class="" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, mono;">mgr</span>”, “<span class="" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, mono;">conf01</span>”,
“<span class="" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, mono;">edge</span>”),
and we can prepend this to the group domain to give the nodes Fully Qualified
Domain Names (FQDNs). We can then use these FQDNs to browse to the nodes (e.g.,
<a href="https://mgr.vc20-osl.pexip.net">https://mgr.vc20-osl.pexip.net</a> or <a href="https://edge.vc20-osl.pexip.net">https://edge.vc20-osl.pexip.net</a>). </p>

<p>When managing devices in this lab, please refer to the lab
sheet for your group. Each task will refer to the relevant lab sheet section if
required. For your information, we have tried to keep the usernames consistent
and passwords simple, with <i>most</i> passwords set to “Pexip123”. However,
some usernames and passwords can be different, especially for cloud services, thus
you should consult the lab sheet.</p><img src="image.png" alt="" role="presentation" class="img-fluid"><br><p></p>
